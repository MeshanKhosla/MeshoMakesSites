        I, Meshan Khosla, founded Mesho Makes Sites after creating a website for
        my parents' store. Recognizing the positive effect the Internet has on
        business growth, I decided to create this business in 2019 to open this
        opportunity to everyone. I will make sure that every website that I make
        is perfect for your business and am willing to make any changes to
        ensure that your website will be beneficial to your business. I will
        design and develop your website according to your liking.

        I have always had an interest in technology. I first learned coding
        basic in my freshman year of high school. In that class I learned
        Javascript basic and have, since then, expanded my knowledge to other
        languages such as Java, Swift, and Python. I learned web development
        through YouTube, where I learned HTML, CSS, more Javascript, and
        frameworks such as Bootstrap and am currently learning React. I have
        also learned Jquery and libraries such as Tweenmax and TimeLine Max.
        Inspired by technology, I joined my school's Robotics team where I am
        currently the lead programmer and am constanstly learning new tech
        stacks to ensure my knowledge stays up to date.
